### **What Is ACID?**
> - **A (Atomicity)**: Atomicity means that you guarantee that either all the transaction succeeds or failure, we commit when transaction succeeds, and we roll back when the transaction failure.
> - **C (Consistency)**: This ensures that all data will be consistent when execute transaction.
> - **I (Isolation)**: All transactions will occur in isolation.
> - **D (Durability)**: Durability means that, once a transaction is committed, it will remain in the system – even if there’s a system crash.

### **What Does High Availability (HA) Mean?**
> - Accessibility refers to the user's ability to access the system. If the user is unable to access the application, it will be assumed that the application is unavailable. High availability means that the application will always be available without interruption.

### **What Is Containerization?**

During the containerization process, the operating system is used concurrently by different containers, so it does not need to be cloned for each virtual machine.
