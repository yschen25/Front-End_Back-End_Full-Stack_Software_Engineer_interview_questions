### **What Is ACID?**
> - **A (Atomicity)**: Atomicity means that you guarantee that either all the transaction succeeds or failure, we commit when transaction succeeds, and we roll back when the transaction failure.
> - **C (Consistency)**: This ensures that all data will be consistent when execute transaction.
> - **I (Isolation)**: All transactions will occur in isolation.
> - **D (Durability)**: Durability means that, once a transaction is committed, it will remain in the system – even if there’s a system crash.
